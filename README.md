## 7. How to Use

### 7.1. Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd News_agent
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The `requirements.txt` file is generated from `uv.lock` using
    [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to guarantee reproducible
    installs. If you need to refresh the lockfile (for example after
    modifying `pyproject.toml`), re-export the pinned requirements with:

    ```bash
    uv export --format requirements-txt --no-dev --no-editable --no-emit-project --output-file requirements.txt
    ```
    
    **Optional - SenseVoice Model Setup:**
    ```bash
    # For enhanced multilingual voice recognition
    mkdir -p models/SenseVoiceSmall
    # Place your SenseVoice model files in models/SenseVoiceSmall/
    # Or set: export SENSEVOICE_MODEL_PATH="/path/to/model"
    ```
3.  **Configure API Keys:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with your API keys:
    ```
    ZHIPUAI_API_KEY="YOUR_ZHIPUAI_API_KEY"
    ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY="YOUR_ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY"
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_ZHIPUAI_API_KEY` and `YOUR_ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY` with your actual keys.

### 7.2. Running the Agent

To start the voice-activated news agent with **smart memory and real-time interruption**:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m src.main
```

Or with Make (no manual activation needed if you use `uv`):

```bash
make src
```

Note: If you encounter `ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package`, make sure you run from the project root and use module mode (`python -m src.main`).

**New Capabilities:**
- 🧠 **Smart Memory**: "Tell me more" intelligently refers to recent news
- ⚡ **Priority Commands**: "Actually, I meant..." cancels previous requests
- 🎙️ **SenseVoice ASR**: Multilingual offline voice recognition
- 🔄 **Threading Architecture**: Lightweight, efficient processing
- 📊 **Complete Logging**: Audio + conversation history saved automatically
