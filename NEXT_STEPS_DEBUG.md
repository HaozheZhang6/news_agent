# WebSocket Debugging - Next Steps

## What We Just Did

1. ‚úÖ **Committed logging changes** to branch `bug-fix-for-backend`
2. ‚úÖ **Improved error logging** - now shows actual exception types and messages
3. ‚úÖ **Fixed retry logic** - added `raise_on_error` parameter to make retries work
4. ‚úÖ **Better disconnect handling** - only disconnects if WebSocket is actually DISCONNECTED state

## What to Test Now

### Test Steps:
1. **Refresh the frontend** browser page (http://localhost:3000)
2. **Click the mic button** to attempt WebSocket connection
3. **Download both logs** after the error:
   - Frontend: Click "Download Logs" button (bottom-right)
   - Backend: `tail -30 logs/detailed/backend_*.log`

## What We're Looking For

The improved logging will now show us:

### In Backend Log:
```
üîå WS_CONNECT | session=XXX | user=XXX
[Should see retry attempts if first fails]
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING | Retry sending connected message (attempt 1): RuntimeError: WebSocket not in CONNECTED state: CONNECTING
[Wait 50ms]
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING | Retry sending connected message (attempt 2): RuntimeError: ...
[Wait 50ms]
‚ùå ERROR | send_connected_failed | All retries exhausted: RuntimeError: ...
```

### Key Questions to Answer:
1. **What is the actual exception?** (now we'll see `RuntimeError:` or `WebSocketException:` etc.)
2. **What is the WebSocket state?** (CONNECTING, CONNECTED, DISCONNECTED, etc.)
3. **Do retries happen?** (should see 3 attempts with 50ms delays)
4. **Does any retry succeed?** (should see "Successfully sent connected message")

## Possible Root Causes

Based on what we'll see:

### Case 1: WebSocket in CONNECTING state
**Problem:** WebSocket.accept() returns before connection is fully established  
**Solution:** Increase the 10ms delay, or wait for state change

### Case 2: WebSocket immediately DISCONNECTED
**Problem:** Frontend closes connection immediately for some reason  
**Solution:** Check frontend WebSocket creation and error handlers

### Case 3: Exception during send_text()
**Problem:** Actual network or protocol error  
**Solution:** Depends on the specific exception type

### Case 4: Session removed from active_connections
**Problem:** Some code path is calling disconnect() prematurely  
**Solution:** Add more defensive checks before disconnect()

## After Testing

Please share:
1. The last 30 lines of the backend log
2. The full frontend log download
3. Any error messages shown in the frontend UI

Then I can determine the **actual** root cause and implement the correct fix!

## If We Still See the Same Error

If the logs still show:
```
‚ùå ERROR | send_message_failed | 
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING | WebSocket not found, skipping message
```

Without showing retry attempts, then the issue is that the WebSocket is being removed from `active_connections` BEFORE we even try to send. This would mean:

1. The `connect()` method is storing the WebSocket
2. Some other code is calling `disconnect()` immediately
3. The send attempt finds no WebSocket

In that case, we need to add logging to `disconnect()` to see who's calling it!
