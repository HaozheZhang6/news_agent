# Docs Alignment

Ensure all code work aligns with documentation in `docs/` with strong traceability.

## Primary Task
- Update or create relevant docs in `docs/` BEFORE code changes, then keep docs and code in sync.

## Required Updates (before coding)
1. Architecture changes → update `docs/docs/reference/SYSTEM_DESIGN_CURRENT.md`
2. API changes → update `docs/docs/reference/API_DESIGN.md`
3. Component/module changes → add/update a guide in `docs/docs/reference/`
4. Testing impact → update `docs/TESTING.md` and (if E2E) `docs/docs/reference/E2E_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
5. Troubleshooting/known issues → update relevant guide in `docs/docs/reference/`

## Traceability Checklist
- [ ] Add a version entry in `docs/VERSION.md` (date, change type, files, summary)
- [ ] Cross-link changed files in the doc (use backticks for paths)
- [ ] Include a short migration/impact note if behavior changes
- [ ] Reference related guides (link to `docs/docs/reference/*.md`)

## Commit Guidance
- Group docs + code in the same commit when feasible
- Use conventional commit style with a docs scope when docs change
  - e.g., `docs(streaming): add SRC streaming guide and E2E steps`

## Done Criteria
All of the following must be true:
- [ ] Docs updated first and reviewed
- [ ] Code implemented to match docs
- [ ] Examples in docs are runnable or clearly marked
- [ ] `docs/VERSION.md` updated
- [ ] Sidebar links updated if new guides were added (`docs/_sidebar.md`)
