```

## Where to Place Docs
- New module/feature → new `docs/docs/reference/<FEATURE_NAME>_GUIDE.md`
- Cross-cutting change → update `SYSTEM_DESIGN_CURRENT.md`
- API-level impact → update `API_DESIGN.md`

## Inquiry Support
- Add a "FAQ / Usage Inquiry" section with common questions and short answers
- Include pointers to tests and examples (e.g., `tests/backend/...`)

## Done Criteria
- [ ] At least one runnable example per major function
- [ ] Backlinks to related docs
- [ ] Section added to sidebar if new file created
